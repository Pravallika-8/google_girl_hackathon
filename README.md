Efficient NOC Design Optimization for SoCs

Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing the design of a Network on Chip (NOC) for System on Chips (SoCs) to be more area and power efficient while achieving desired performance metrics for latency and bandwidth. The project involves developing a custom simulator to model the behavior of the NOC components and implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to optimize the design. 

Problem Statement
The goal is to design a NOC that can efficiently handle different types of workloads running on the CPU and IO peripherals, while minimizing area and power consumption. 

Approach
- Develop a custom simulator to model the behavior of the SoC components.
- Implement a DQN algorithm to optimize the NOC design based on performance metrics.
- Compare the optimized NOC design with a baseline design to evaluate improvements.

Proof of Correctness
The correctness of the optimized NOC design can be validated through simulation and comparison with the baseline design.

Complexity Analysis
The complexity lies in developing an efficient NOC design that meets the performance requirements while minimizing area and power consumption. 

Alternatives Considered
Alternative optimization algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Actor-Critic algorithms were considered but were not chosen due to their complexity.
